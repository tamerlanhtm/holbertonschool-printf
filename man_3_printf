MAIN(1)                        User Commands Manual                        MAIN(1)

NAME
       main - A simple program that demonstrates the usage of the _printf function

SYNOPSIS
       #include "main.h"

       int main(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The main function serves as the entry point for a C program. In the context of this
       specific implementation, it demonstrates how to use the _printf function to print
       different types of data to the standard output (usually the terminal). The program
       demonstrates printing a character, a string, and an integer.

       In the first example, the program prints:
           - A character with the %c format specifier
           - A string with the %s format specifier
           - An integer with the %d format specifier

       The second example attempts to use the _printf function with improper arguments
       and incorrect formatting, leading to errors.

PARAMETERS
       The program does not accept command-line parameters. The inputs to the _printf
       function in both examples are hardcoded within the program.

       The arguments passed to _printf in the first example are:
           - A character: 'H'
           - A string: "Hello, world!"
           - An integer: 60

       In the second example, the program attempts to pass:
           - An integer: 1
           - Three additional arguments (2, 3, and "hello") that are not correctly handled.

RETURN VALUE
       The main function itself returns 0, indicating successful completion of the program.

EXAMPLES
       Example Code 1:

           #include "main.h"

           int main(void)
           {
               _printf("Character: %c\n", 'H');
               _printf("String: %s\n", Hello, world!");
               _printf("Ieger: %d\n", 60);
               return (0);
           }

           Output:
               Character: H
               String: Hello, world!
               Integer: 60

       Example Code 2:

           #include "main.h"

           int main(void)
           {
               _printf("%d", 1, 2, 3, "hello");
               return (0);
           }

           Output: This will result in an error, as the arguments passed to _printf do not
           match the expected format string.

ERRORS
       Example Code 2 will result in errors such as:
           - Too many arguments passed to the _printf function
           - Format specifier mismatch with arguments
